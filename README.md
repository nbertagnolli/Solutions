# Overview

This repository holds bits and pieces of code, and worked solutions to various
textbooks that I've been working through.  I wanted to keep all of my solutions in a common place for easy reference, and figured why not make it available to everyone else as well : ).

I don't gaurantee the correctness of any of the solutions so reference at your own risk.  If however, you see anything that is wrong please let me know.  I'm self studying from these texts and would love to know if I've made an error.
