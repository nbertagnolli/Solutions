\subsection*{Problem 3}
The Probability of Selecting an Apple can be decomposed as:
\begin{align*}
\prob(apple) &= \prob(apple, red) + \prob(apple, blue) + prob(apple, green)\\ 
&= \prob(apple | red)\prob(red) + \prob(apple | blue) \prob(blue) + \prob(apple | green)\prob(green)\\
&= (.3)(.2) +(.5)(.2) + (.3)(.6)\\
&= .34
\end{align*}

The probability that observing an orange came from the green box can be solved using Bayes rule:

\begin{align*}
\prob(green | orange) &= \frac{\prob(orange | green)\prob(green)}{\prob(orange)}\\
&= \frac{(.3)(.6)}{.66}\\
&= .27
\end{align*}
